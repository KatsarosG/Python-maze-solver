# Python-maze-solver
A generic python maze solver.

Not very efficient but simple png image based maze solver.

MazeSolver.py solves the maze in the background.
MazeSolverView.py solves the maze with a real time output.(slower)

Mazes need to have:
  •black pixels as walls.
  •white pixels as paths.
  •black surrounding wall.
  •one white pixel on the top as start.
  •one white pixel on the bottom as end.

Mazes where created with Daedalus (http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm).
