# Python-maze-solver
A generic python maze solver.

Not very efficient but simple png image based maze solver.
Mazes where created with Daedalus (http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm).

Mazes need to have:
  black pixels as walls
  while pixels as paths
  black surrounding wall
  one white pixel on the top as start
  one white pixel on the bottom as end.
